Lesson 2: SRE Roles and Responsibilities in the Enterprise
In this lesson we'll:

Identify the formation of SRE in the industry
Compare SRE work vs. adjacent roles
Explain core skills of SRE
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to understand how SRE was formed and identify the core skills of SRE.

Lesson 3: Improving Enterprise Workflows with SRE Best Practices
Identify common SRE best practices
Explore enterprise workflows that can be improved with SRE
Perform cost-benefit analysis of SRE
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to identify SRE best practices, how those fit in the workplace and understand the costs of SRE.

Lesson 4: SRE Teams
Illustrate collaboration best practices with the development team
Define an SRE team

Lesson 5: Monitoring System Performance
Install and configure a monitoring system using Prometheus and Grafana
Identify host metrics and create a dashboard with host metrics
Install and configure a synthetic monitoring solution
Create alerts for application metrics
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to install a monitoring stack, understand host metrics, and create alerts for an application.

How It All Comes Together
We first establish where SRE comes from and learn which roles it is responsible for compared to other teams. Once we understand the SRE responsibilities, we can see how it fits in an organization and more importantly, how it improves an organization. We then take a look at the SRE Team itself, and learn about how it uses some of the most-used tools in the industry to be effective.

In short, this course takes you from non-existent SRE to how an SRE team is formed and provides the tools that are commonly used by these professionals in the field.

# Who SRE's work with
It really depends on the organization but the teams you work with could include:

Development -- you will probably interface with this team the most, as there are a lot of overlapping tasks.
DevOps -- since DevOps typically owns the delivery of software, they will be interested to know how well it is performing for end users.
QA -- SRE and QA may have more of a consulting relationship since both teams use automation
Support -- this team is on the front line with clients and may need a hand from SRE teams for more technical issues.
